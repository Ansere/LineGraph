# Line Graph

A program to visualize data as an animated line graph. Some code is adapted from my own [bar graph repository](https://github.com/Ansere/SciolyBotBarGraph) which itself is adapted from carykh's [bar graph code](https://github.com/carykh/AbacabaTutorialDrawer).

## Features
- Easily make your own animated line graph with automatic scaling
- Add your own audio
- Adjust the smoothing of data values in the output and how fast the animation runs

## Usage
- Download this repository and unzip everything
